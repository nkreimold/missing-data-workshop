## Prerequistes

Please run check_env.ipynb. It checks the versions of your python and some packages (like pandas, sklearn, xgboost). If the notebook returns all OK, you should be able to run missing_data_in_supervised_ML.ipynb without issues. If some FAILs are returned, you need to install/update those packages first. 

## Description

`missing_data_in_supervised_ML.ipynb` is the main notebook, the slides of the presentation. The notebook is also available in pdf format for convenience.
